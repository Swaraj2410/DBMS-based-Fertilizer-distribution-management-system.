ðŸŒ¾ Fertilizer Management System | DBMS-Based Web Application
The Fertilizer Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the distribution and management of fertilizers in agricultural sectors using modern database techniques. Built using Python Flask as the backend framework and MySQL as the database, it enables efficient and transparent operations for two user roles: Agricultural Officers and Farmers.

This system allows officers to add fertilizers, distribute stock to regional stores, and approve or decline farmer requests. Farmers, on the other hand, can log in to check availability and submit fertilizer requests. The platform ensures role-based access, secure CRUD operations, and live inventory tracking using ER-modeled database design. Dynamic dashboards for each user role are developed using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, offering an intuitive user experience even in low-tech environments.

The system emphasizes modularity, security, and scalability, enabling future enhancements such as SMS alerts, mobile access, and AI-based fertilizer recommendations. With proper authentication and transactional integrity, it presents a real-world application of DBMS concepts tailored to digital agriculture.
